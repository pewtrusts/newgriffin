# Griffin v5 and v4 

## v5 branch
This branch is the Griffin code that converts a chart template produced by the new (database-based) [https://github.com/pewtrusts/chart-builder-v5](Griffin Chart Builder) into an interactive chart by passing data to Highcharts.

The Chart Builder uses this repo as a submodule. When the new version of Griffin charts goes live, they will need this repo's built files to be packaged and uploaded to Sitecore.

Those built files are currently stored in the `~/media/data-visualizations/interactives/griffin-v5` directory of the media library.

## v4 branch
v4 is the code for the previous, nondatabase-based version of Griffin currently (as of April 2022) used for Griffin charts on the live site.
