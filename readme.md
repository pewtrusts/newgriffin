# Griffin v5 

This repo is the Griffin code that converts a chart template produced by the new (database-based) [https://github.com/pewtrusts/chart-builder-v5](Griffin Chart Builder) into an interactive chart by passing data to Highcharts.

The Chart Builder uses this repo as a submodule. When the new version of Griffin charts goes live, they will need this repo's built files to be packaged and uploaded to Sitecore.

Those built files are currently stored in the `~/media/data-visualizations/interactives/griffin-v5` directory of the media library.
